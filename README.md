# What is this?
This bash script is designed to automate setup for my personal Linux VM instances. I intend to add to it as time passes and I customize my VMs more.

# To use: 
1. Download using `git clone https://github.com/jada-cumberland/linux_setup.git`
2. `cd linux_setup`
3. Add execute perms to *setup.sh*: `chmod +x setup.sh`
4. Run the file: `sudo ./setup.sh`
